# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

## Creating a New Spec

When adding a new feature or making significant changes:

1. Create a new spec file in `openspec/` directory
2. Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
3. Follow the spec template structure
4. Reference the spec in implementation

## Spec Format

Each spec should include:
- **Title**: Clear feature name
- **Description**: What the feature does
- **Requirements**: Detailed requirements
- **Implementation**: Technical details
- **Testing**: How to test

## Applying Specs

After creating a spec:
1. Implement the changes according to the spec
2. Update relevant documentation (README.md)
3. Test the implementation
4. Mark spec as implemented
